 * This class stands for mode-revenue-calculation EnumType

 * - documentation: Mode for manual revenue/commission calculations based on value in value-revenue-calculation-element: (naming is case sensitive!) - "Calculated commission" -> set the calculated commission directly by value-revenue-calculation. -
 * "Commission|%" -> calculate the commission in percent (value-revenue-calculation) based on original-price (in case of foreign currency) or total-price - "Price" -> the commission is the different between total-price and value-revenue-calculation -
 * "Buying price foreign" -> value-revenue-calculation is foreign currency and replaces original_price. The commission is the difference between total-price and value-revenue-calculation (by base currency)
